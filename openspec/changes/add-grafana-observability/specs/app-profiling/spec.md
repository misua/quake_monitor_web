## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Continuous Profiling Integration

The application SHALL integrate with Grafana Cloud Profiles (Pyroscope) to provide continuous CPU and memory profiling for debugging segmentation faults and performance issues.

#### Scenario: Profiling enabled with valid credentials

- **WHEN** the application starts with `PROFILING_ENABLED=true` and valid Grafana Cloud credentials
- **THEN** the Pyroscope SDK SHALL initialize and begin sending profiling data to Grafana Cloud
- **AND** profiling overhead SHALL be less than 5% CPU usage
- **AND** application startup SHALL not be blocked by profiling initialization

#### Scenario: Profiling disabled by configuration

- **WHEN** the application starts with `PROFILING_ENABLED=false` or the variable is not set
- **THEN** profiling SHALL NOT be initialized
- **AND** the application SHALL function normally without any profiling overhead
- **AND** no connection attempts SHALL be made to Grafana Cloud

#### Scenario: Profiling fails to initialize

- **WHEN** profiling is enabled but Grafana Cloud credentials are invalid or missing
- **THEN** the application SHALL log a warning about profiling initialization failure
- **AND** the application SHALL continue to start and function normally
- **AND** no profiling data SHALL be sent

### Requirement: Environment-Based Configuration

The profiling system SHALL be configured entirely through environment variables to support different deployment environments and keep credentials secure.

#### Scenario: Complete profiling configuration provided

- **WHEN** all required environment variables are set (`PROFILING_ENABLED`, `PYROSCOPE_SERVER_URL`, `PYROSCOPE_USERNAME`, `PYROSCOPE_API_KEY`)
- **THEN** profiling SHALL initialize with the provided configuration
- **AND** credentials SHALL NOT be logged or exposed in application output
- **AND** profiling tags SHALL include environment metadata (environment name, version, region)

#### Scenario: Configuration template available

- **WHEN** a developer sets up the application for the first time
- **THEN** the `.env.example` file SHALL contain all required profiling environment variables with placeholder values
- **AND** documentation SHALL explain how to obtain Grafana Cloud credentials
- **AND** the README SHALL include step-by-step setup instructions

### Requirement: Endpoint-Specific Profiling Labels

The application SHALL support adding profiling labels to critical API endpoints to enable granular performance analysis.

#### Scenario: Critical endpoint profiled with labels

- **WHEN** a request is made to a critical endpoint (earthquake data, weather data, monitoring data)
- **THEN** the profiling data SHALL include labels identifying the endpoint and data source
- **AND** labels SHALL include `endpoint` name and `data_source` type
- **AND** labels SHALL be visible in Grafana Cloud flame graphs for filtering

#### Scenario: Background task profiling

- **WHEN** scheduled background tasks execute (data fetching, monitoring)
- **THEN** profiling data SHALL include labels identifying the task type
- **AND** task execution SHALL be traceable in profiling timeline
- **AND** profiling SHALL capture any crashes during background task execution

### Requirement: Profiling Data Retention and Access

The application SHALL send profiling data to Grafana Cloud with appropriate retention and access controls.

#### Scenario: Profile data sent to Grafana Cloud

- **WHEN** profiling is enabled and the application is running
- **THEN** profile samples SHALL be sent to Grafana Cloud at the configured sample rate (default 100Hz)
- **AND** data SHALL be retained for 15 days (Grafana Cloud free tier)
- **AND** profiles SHALL be viewable in the Grafana Cloud Profiles UI
- **AND** flame graphs SHALL be generated for CPU usage analysis

#### Scenario: Segmentation fault debugging

- **WHEN** a segmentation fault occurs while profiling is enabled
- **THEN** profiling data leading up to the crash SHALL be available in Grafana Cloud
- **AND** flame graphs SHALL show the call stack and CPU usage patterns before the crash
- **AND** developers SHALL be able to identify the source of the segmentation fault from profiling data

### Requirement: Minimal Application Changes

The profiling integration SHALL require minimal changes to existing application code to reduce risk and maintain code simplicity.

#### Scenario: Non-invasive profiling initialization

- **WHEN** profiling is added to the application
- **THEN** initialization SHALL occur in a single location (application startup)
- **AND** existing business logic SHALL NOT be modified
- **AND** profiling SHALL be optional and not affect application behavior when disabled
- **AND** no new dependencies SHALL be added beyond the Pyroscope SDK

#### Scenario: Optional endpoint instrumentation

- **WHEN** developers want to add profiling labels to specific endpoints
- **THEN** labels SHALL be added using context managers that don't alter endpoint logic
- **AND** endpoints SHALL function identically with or without profiling labels
- **AND** profiling labels SHALL be self-documenting and not require external configuration

### Requirement: Documentation and Setup Guidance

The application SHALL include comprehensive documentation for setting up and using Grafana Cloud Profiles.

#### Scenario: Developer sets up profiling for first time

- **WHEN** a developer wants to enable profiling
- **THEN** the README SHALL provide step-by-step instructions for:
  - Creating a Grafana Cloud account (free tier)
  - Locating Pyroscope credentials in Grafana Cloud
  - Configuring environment variables
  - Verifying profiling data in Grafana Cloud UI
- **AND** documentation SHALL include troubleshooting steps for common issues
- **AND** documentation SHALL explain how to interpret flame graphs

#### Scenario: Troubleshooting profiling issues

- **WHEN** profiling is not working as expected
- **THEN** documentation SHALL provide troubleshooting steps for:
  - Verifying credentials are correct
  - Checking network connectivity to Grafana Cloud
  - Validating profiling is enabled in environment
  - Viewing profiling logs for errors
- **AND** documentation SHALL include links to Grafana Cloud Profiles documentation
